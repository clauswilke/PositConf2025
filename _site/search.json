If you’re an R user, you probably also want to use the knitr engine instead of the jupyter engine, which you can select with the engine setting. To use the knitr engine, you also need to include a custom quarto file that comes with the Quarto-live extension.\n---\nformat: live-html\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n{{&lt; include ./_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd &gt;}}\nFor more documentation on the quarto live extension, see here: https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/\nYou can also check out the source of this interactive worksheet here: https://github.com/clauswilke/PositConf2025/blob/main/worksheets/worksheet.qmd"
