# PositConf2025

This repository contains materials for Claus O. Wilke's talk at
Posit::conf(2025). You can see the rendered website here:
https://clauswilke.com/PositConf2025/

The rendered site is entirely composed of static html pages,
located in `_site`. The site can be served with any web server
that serves static pages, such as GitHub Pages.

To rebuild the site, run the following in the top-level directory:

```sh
quarto render
```
