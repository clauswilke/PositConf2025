First we need to load the required R packages. Please wait a moment until the live R session is fully set up and all packages are loaded.

```{webr}
#| warning: false
#| edit: false
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Next we take a look at the data. We'll be working with the `penguins` dataset from the **palmerpenguins** package.

```{webr}
#| edit: false
penguins
```

Now make a scatter plot of bill length versus body mass, coloring the points by penguin species.

```{webr} 
#| exercise: ggplot-example
ggplot(___) +
  aes(___) +
  ___()
```

::: { .hint exercise="ggplot-example" }
::: { .callout-tip title="Hint 1" collapse="false"}
The dataset is provided as the argument to the `ggplot()` function.
```r
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(___) +
  ___()
```
:::
:::

::: { .hint exercise="ggplot-example" }
::: { .callout-tip title="Hint 2" collapse="false"}
The variable `body_mass_g` goes on the x axis, the variable `bill_length_mm` goes on the y axis, and `species` is used to assign color.
```r
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, color = species) +
  ___()
```
:::
:::

::: { .solution exercise="ggplot-example" }
::: { .callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="false"}
The complete code to make the requested scatter plot. Use `na.rm = TRUE` to avoid warnings about missing data values.
```r
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, color = species) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Installation and setup

To enable live R exercises in your own Quarto documents, install the quarto-live extension:

```sh
quarto add r-wasm/quarto-live
```

For any worksheet that you want to contain live exercises, you need to set the format to `live-html` in the YAML header. If you're an R user, you probably also want to use the `knitr` engine instead of the `jupyter` engine, which you can select with the `engine` setting. To use the `knitr` engine, you also need to include a custom quarto file that comes with the Quarto-live extension.

```yaml
---
format: live-html
engine: knitr
---

{{{< include ./_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd >}}}
```

For more documentation on the quarto live extension, see here: <https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/>
