## Requirements for an R-based data science class

:::{.small-font}
- Website
- Slides with code and output
- Interactive exercises
- Student assignments
- Demo/support apps
:::

## Challenges: Interactive exercises

:::{.small-font}
- shiny/learnr requires a backend webserver
- alternatively, students can run learnr documents locally, but that's ugly
:::

## Challenges: Student assignments

:::{.small-font}
- in general, pdf is the best format for submissions
- converting markdown into pdf is complicated (latex installation etc.)
:::

## Challenges: Demo/support apps

:::{.small-font}
- Same problems as learnr documents, need webserver or run locally
:::

## Quarto with webr and typst can do everything we need
